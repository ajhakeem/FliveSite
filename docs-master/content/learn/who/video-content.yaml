why:
  title@: Grow engagement and increase conversions with faster experiences
  reasons:
    - title@: Keep your audience engaged with AMP pages
      paragraph@: AMP pages typically load in under one second. That means when your target audience lands on an AMP page, they get what they’re looking for in the moment they’re looking for it. The net result -- they’re more likely to be engaged with and receptive to your brand’s messages, and more likely to take the actions you’re guiding them towards like completing a purchase.

    - title@: Boost your campaign performance with AMP Ads
      paragraph@: Even the most memorable creative won’t serve its purpose if the ad is slow and disruptive for a user. AMP Ads are a new way of building ads, making them as fast as AMP pages to ensure your ads do what they’re meant to do and deliver the value you’re looking for.

    - title@: Maximize ROI everywhere
      paragraph@: Building the right ad, landing page or web content takes time. With AMP Ads, your ads can serve on both AMP and non-AMP pages, meaning you can build your AMP Ads once and deliver a memorable brand experience everywhere. Similarly, AMP pages can be built once and distributed across a wide variety of distribution platforms simultaneously.
