- answer: Telugu Actors can get started by Fan Stories by simply registering at https://fanstories.co.
    Subsequently, they can setup a Fan Stories blog or (site) with their custom domain
    in a few minutes.
  question: How do I get started?
- answer: For large video publishers - publish video ads on our video ad server OR
    enable third party ads.  OR monetize with subscriptions. You can launch subscriptions
    ($1-10 monthly) using Fan Stories. ~Paid subscriptions work best for actors who
    have limited traffic. A paywall will prompt users to subscribe and pay. ~ Ads
    - Google AdWords for monetization (works best for sites with very large traffic)
    ~ Video ad serving, works best for N with very high video content.
  question: What kind of monetization options works best for Telegu Actors?
- answer: Fan Stories leverages your social media presence to connect and distribute
    your content through your Facebook page. We take authorization to collect your
    Facebook Page list. We do not publish anything without your permission and all
    content shared on Facebook is content that you will explicitly choose to share.
  question: Why do I need to share my Facebook Authentication while registering for
    Fan Stories?
- answer: At the moment of time, we make monthly payments to Telugu Actors. We anticipate
    to make changes, to make these payments sooner. Payments are paid using PayPal,
    and wire transfers.
  question: How frequently do I get paid and how do I get paid?
- answer: We recommend Telugu Actors bring a minimum thresh-hold of monetizable visitors.
    For example, for a news site 100k visitors would work great if you're monetizing
    via paid subscriptions. But for ads, these numbers are too small

  paragraph@: Fan Stories helps Telegu movie actors by helping them to build their
    own video portal which operates with Netflix style subscriptions or with ads.
    As a  movie actor, you might have a large captive audience on youtube. But the
    monetization on youtube is too low to make a living. Fan stories provide the tools
    and the technology to help you publish, establish your own presence and monetize
    it in no time.
