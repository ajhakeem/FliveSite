why:
  title@: How AMP can help publishers
  reasons:
    - title@: Enable compelling, consistently fast experiences
      paragraph@: AMP speeds up content, keeping users engaged irrespective of where they start their journey -- on the publisher’s own website or from platforms that link to AMP pages like Twitter, Google and Pinterest. With faster and more secure ads, AMP ads deliver great advertising experiences too, ensuring every interaction with a publisher’s brand is a compelling one.

    - title@: Strengthen your business while maintaining control
      paragraph@: Publishers implementing AMP can decide how to present their content, what business model to use, what technology vendors to use, while maintaining and often improving key performance indicators, such as time spent on page, return visits, viewability, CTRs and more.

    - title@: Reduce complexity in your operations.
      paragraph@: Building AMP pages is simple and straightforward. You can often convert your entire archive in days especially if you use a popular CMS such as Wordpress and Drupal. Your teams do not need any special skills nor worry about optimizing your code for each distribution platform as the AMP format is fully portable and AMP pages are consistently fast no matter how a user gets to them.  Similarly, AMP ads may be built once and run across all pages, including non-AMP pages.
