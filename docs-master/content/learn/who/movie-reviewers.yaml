  question: How frequently do I get paid and how do I get paid?
- answer: We recommend Movie reviewers bring a minimum thresh-hold of monetizable
    visitors. For example, for a news site 100k visitors would work great if you're
    monetizing via paid subscriptions. But for ads, these numbers are too small
