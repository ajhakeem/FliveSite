  question: How do I get started?

    (works best for sites with very large traffic) ~Paid subscriptions work best for
    News Publishers who have limited traffic. A paywall will prompt users to subscribe
    and pay. ~ Ads - Google AdWords for monetization (works best for sites with very
    large traffic) ~ Video ad serving, works best s with very high video content.
  question: What kind of monetization options works best for Sports Reporters?
- answer: Fan Stories leverages your social media presence to connect and distribute
    your content through your Facebook page. We take authorization to collect your
    Facebook Page list. We do not publish anything without your permission and all
    content shared on Facebook is content that you will explicitly choose to share.
  question: Why do I need to share my Facebook Authentication while registering for
    Fan Stories?
- answer: At the moment of time, we make monthly payments to Sports Reporters. We
    anticipate to make changes, to make these payments sooner. Payments are paid using
    PayPal, and wire transfers.
  question: How frequently do I get paid and how do I get paid?
- answer: We recommend Sports Reporters can bring a minimum thresh-hold of monetizable
    visitors. For example, for a news site 100k visitors would work great if you're
    monetizing via paid subscriptions. But for ads, these numbers are too small
