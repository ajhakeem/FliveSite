    <h3>AMP Conf Accessibility</h3>

    <p>The AMP Conf is an inclusive conference and wants to be accessible.</p>

    <p>We make sure that the AMP Conf is well accessible to people with physical disabilities, by both checking with the venue owner and by visiting them personally beforehand.</p>

    <p>However, we are aware that accessibility issues are diverse and this does not cover everything.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in our conference, but have any kind of accessibility problem that needs to be resolved before you can attend, please <a href="mailto:amp-conf-2017@google.com">get in contact</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are in need of an assistant, they will not be required to request a ticket.</p>

    <p>We would love to welcome you to AMP Conf!</p>
