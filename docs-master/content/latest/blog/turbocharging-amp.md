<p><strong>Improving speed and user experience on the web is core to the AMP Project’s mission. Today at Google’s I/O developer conference we announced that </strong><b>AMP pages load twice as fast from Google Search, </b><strong>as</strong> <strong>we’ve cut the time it takes to render content in half from last year. Additionally, new platforms and websites have joined the AMP ecosystem, </strong><b>giving hundreds of millions more users the lightning-fast AMP experience</b><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AMP’s new speed gains in Google Search are due to several key optimizations that we made to the Google AMP Cache, such as server-side rendering of AMP components, and </strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/01/google-amp-cache-amp-lite-and-need-for.html"><strong>reducing bandwidth usage from images by 50%</strong></a><strong> without affecting the perceived quality. We also used a compression algorithm called </strong><a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/09/introducing-brotli-new-compression.html"><strong>Brotli</strong></a><strong> that Google launched a couple years ago, resulting in a reduced document size by an additional 10% in supported browsers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Globally AMP continues to grow its footprint, with the news that China&#8217;s largest social network </strong><b>Tencent Qzone</b><strong> and the country&#8217;s third largest, </strong><b>Weibo</b><strong> will show AMP pages to hundreds of millions of users. This follows an announcement at the first AMP conference in March when </strong><a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/amp-grows-its-footprint/amp/"><b>Baidu</b><strong>, </strong><b>Sogou</b><strong> and</strong><b> Yahoo Japan</b><strong> said they are linking to AMP pages</strong></a><strong> from their Search results, joining Bing and Google.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other social platforms also made announcements, with </strong><b>Tumblr</b><strong> telling developers at Google I/O it is publishing 340M blogs across 500K domains in AMP. And </strong><b>Twitter</b><strong> shared that they are linking to AMP pages from their new mobile web app, and are in the process of launching AMP support in their Android and iOS apps. The global reach of these platforms further extends the availability of the 2B+ AMP pages and 900K domains with AMP on the web. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally, e-commerce sites are benefiting from AMP’s speed and user experience. At AMP Conf, </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/wompmobile/"><strong>WompMobile</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/wego/"><strong>Wego</strong></a><strong> shared their initial success seeing 95% and 105% increase in conversion rates with AMP respectively. In the months since then, new e-commerce websites have joined the AMP ecosystem, including </strong><b>eBay</b><strong> announcing their plan to use AMP across all their product pages, </strong><b>Zalando</b><strong> implementing AMP for 250K product pages, and </strong><b>Myntra</b><strong> taking advantage of the powerful new </strong><a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2017/04/19/test-amp-bind-on-your-site-with-an-origin-trial/amp/"><strong>amp-bind component</strong></a><strong>. Additionally, </strong><b>AliExpress</b><strong>, one of China’s biggest online marketplaces, is having success with AMP pages, seeing a 4% uplift in conversions. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Many of AMP&#8217;s e-commerce capabilities were previewed at the AMP Conf and the </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind"><strong>amp-bind component</strong></a><strong> is now available for </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/test-amp-bind-on-your-site-with-an-origin-trial/"><strong>origin trials</strong></a><strong>, creating a new interaction model for elements on AMP pages.
