<p><strong>Last month we held our first </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf-2017"><strong>AMP Conf</strong></a><strong>, and it was a blast. Over 300 of you showed up in-person, and thousands tuned into the live stream.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over two days, </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXTOW_XMsIDTDXYO-NAi2OpEH0zyguvqX"><strong>19 talks, panels and workshops</strong></a><strong> – with over half from outside the AMP team – covered topics including building interactive AMP pages and using AMP pages for e-commerce. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you couldn’t make it to AMP Conf, you can relive and </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXTOW_XMsIDTDXYO-NAi2OpEH0zyguvqX"><strong>watch all the talks on the AMP Channel</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='402' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLXTOW_XMsIDTDXYO-NAi2OpEH0zyguvqX&#038;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>
<p><strong>We had many <a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/amp-grows-its-footprint/"><span >community announcements</strong></a><strong>, such as Baidu, Sogou, and Yahoo Japan linking to AMP pages. The core AMP team had lots to share as well</strong>&#8211; among the announcements at AMP Conf:</span></p>
<ul>
<li ><a href="https://ampstart.com/"><strong>AMP Start</strong></a><strong>, a quick-start library of AMP page templates and components</strong></li>
<li ><strong>The </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/dynamic/amp-bind"><strong>amp-bind</strong></a><strong> component, allowing for custom interactivity on AMP pages</strong></li>
<li ><strong>Our new </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPBsjgKKG2HqsKBhWA4uQw"><strong>AMP YouTube channel</strong></a><strong> and the new </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXTOW_XMsIDTIRIu4Af-bqfGkUhPSE75A"><strong>Amplify video series</strong></a></li>
<li ><strong>A redesigned </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/"><strong>AMP website</strong></a><strong>, coded entirely using AMP,  with new </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/"><strong>case studies</strong></a><strong> and content</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And dear to my heart were the thoughtful discussions many of us had with people at the conference looking at the AMP Project’s direction. A lot of the conversations were captured in detail during the </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsaS0R2GChc&amp;t=80s&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLXTOW_XMsIDTDXYO-NAi2OpEH0zyguvqX"><strong>AMP &amp; the web</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRobCzJPihY&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLXTOW_XMsIDTDXYO-NAi2OpEH0zyguvqX"><strong>The roles platform play</strong></a><strong> panels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We might not have all the right solutions yet, but with your help we can get there. It’s clear that we still have much to do, but AMP Conf opened the door for more open collaboration and conversation with the web community. So </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/contribute/"><strong>get involved</strong></a><strong> and come help us! Creating a long-term, healthy mobile web ecosystem is complex and needs the voices of many. </strong></p>
<p><strong>See you soon at another conference!</strong></p>
