And we have a </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/author-develop/pwa-amp"><strong>new set of docs</strong></a><strong> on AMPproject.org to help with just that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AMP makes for an ideal entry point into your site due to the almost-instant prerendered load, and the </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/dynamic/amp-install-serviceworker"><strong>&lt;amp-install-serviceworker&gt;</strong></a><strong> component allows you to warm up and preload a Progressive Web App while your users are reading an AMP page. Users clicking on links to your origin will now instantly upgrade to the full-featured Progressive Web App. This means you can start fast with AMP and stay fast with your Progressive Web App experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition, you can now reuse the entire content library you already have in the form of AMP pages and use them as a centerpiece in your Progressive Web App, saving engineering resources and complexity.</strong></p>
