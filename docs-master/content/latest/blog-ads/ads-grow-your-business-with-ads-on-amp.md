<p><strong>We understand that every business is different, but one thing common to them all in today’s mobile driven world is the need to ensure a fast user experience across all screens. That is why we believe the growing AMP ecosystem is so important. It brings together a diverse community of publishers, advertisers, and technology platforms all working together towards a better, faster, and more secure open web. Over 100 technology platforms </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/learn/who/"><strong>currently support AMP</strong></a><strong>, and the number continues to increase as each organization realizes the importance of delivering a fast user experience across all screens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We also know that advertising is an important part of many web business. Many members of the AMP community have asked for guidance on how to best monetize their AMP pages. Today, we’d like to share our </strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/ads_on_amp"><strong>guide for serving ads on AMP</strong></a><strong>. This guide brings together best practices from a range of publishers with the goal of helping you succeed with AMP in your own way.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One such publisher is <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/hearst/">Hearst Communications</a>. To date, Hearst has published over one million AMP pages, and counting, across its various business units, resulting in significant improvements in viewability, ad engagement, and user traffic on properties such as Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Chron.com.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hearst’s implementation of AMP exemplifies many of the best practices recommended in the guide. To ensure AMP fit their business needs, Hearst took the following steps:</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, they carried over their successful monetization strategies from non-AMP pages to AMP pages. They then started optimizing those strategies for AMP, continuously iterating and adapting to the results they saw. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Next, Hearst implemented more than 10 ad tech and analytics partners to supplement their monetization efforts. Coupled with the inherent speed of AMP, Hearst saw a 29% increase in ad viewability and 45% increase in CTR on their AMP pages. </strong></p>
<p><strong>As with any web page, simply publishing an AMP page doesn’t guarantee success &#8212; optimizing AMP to meet your business needs and partner relationships is key. As the ecosystem continues to grow, we look forward to seeing each and every success story as we collectively make the mobile web better for everyone.</strong></p>
